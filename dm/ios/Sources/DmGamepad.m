// Virtual gamepad (Nintendo button positions) + physical controllers (GameController), handed to the host through dm_input_set and dm_pad_set_player (hle_hid.c, bit layout in dm_input.h).
//   Two layouts, three in handheld mode, chosen in the in-game menu (InGameMenu.swift), which the menu button at the top centre opens (as do a controller's Home button and − and + held
//   together); the choice is kept in NSUserDefaults (each game is its own app, so per game); the first launch uses the game profile's pad_layout (DM_GAME_PAD_LAYOUT). The menu also sets the
//   controls' opacity and size, hides them (all but the menu button) and opens the layout editor, which moves each group of controls by drag (the stick, the D-pad, the diamond, each shoulder
//   pair, − and +, L3 and R3, the menu button); the offsets are kept in the same defaults, in layout units so they follow the size. While the menu or the editor is up, nothing reaches the game.
//   Tap (touch): no control but the menu button, every other touch goes to the game's local touch viewport; offered only while the game is in handheld mode, the only one in which it reads the touch screen (Balatro, played by touch).
//   2D (simple): top corners ZL above L (one column), ZR above R likewise, teardrops with the tip toward the screen corner; − and + side by side at the top centre; the left stick in the bottom-left corner (fixed ring, tilt measured from the ring centre, small dead zone);
//     the A (right) B (bottom) X (top) Y (left) diamond in the bottom-right corner, sliding a finger between keys switches keys. Each bottom corner holds a single control, so it sits close in (reaching halfway into the side safe-area inset).
//   3D (full, Pro Controller style): everything in 2D (left stick and diamond keep their place and size), plus a D-pad (inward of and below the left stick, 8-way), a right stick that is not drawn
//     (a touch landing in the right third of the screen on no control holds it: centred where it lands, the centre dragged along once the finger passes the stick radius) and L3 / R3 (small round keys in the top row, inward of ZL / ZR).
//     Breath of the Wild crouches with L3 and uses the scope with R3; 3D World and Breath of the Wild turn the camera with the right stick.
//   Touch-down ownership: the menu button where it is nearer than a locked key (menuTakes), locked keys next (shoulders, − / +, L3 / R3), then whichever of the diamond, the D-pad and the left stick has the smallest distance / grab radius (the left stick's grab circle borders the D-pad),
//     then in 3D the right stick for a touch in the right third.
//   Everything hugs the edges and corners to leave the picture room; controls sit over the picture, one CAShapeLayer each: a press only swaps the fill, a stick only moves its knob, nothing redraws the whole screen.
//   Touches no control takes (in 3D, those outside the right third) go to the game's touch screen when DmLayout assigns a local game viewport (pushGame; Super Mario Galaxy's pointer in handheld mode).
//   The virtual gamepad (all but the menu button) hides while a physical controller is connected and comes back when it is removed; unclaimed touches go to the game only when a local game viewport exists. Physical controllers keep every button (D-pad and right stick included) and map by position: bottom = B, right = A, left = Y, top = X (same positions as on a Switch controller); a Nintendo pad maps by its labels (pad_apple.h).
//   Each physical controller is a player of its own (local co-op), as on the Mac: the first one connected is player 1, together with the touch gamepad, the next player 2, and so on up to 8; see "Physical controllers" below.
//   Shaking the phone shakes the controller (DM_BTN_SHAKE: its six-axis sensor, hle_hid.c), whichever controls are in use; see "Shaking the phone" below.

// ---- The phone's gyro ----
// A controller mounted on the phone (Backbone One, Razer Kishi, GameSir G8) has no motion sensors of its own: the phone in the middle is the console, as a Switch in handheld.
// So the phone's device motion (gyro + accelerometer, CoreMotion's fused gravity and user acceleration, 100 Hz, no permission prompt) drives player 1's six-axis sensor, turned
// into the Switch frame for the screen's orientation (motion_phone_to_switch, motion_fusion.h): x to the right of the picture, y to its top, z toward the player.
// The host keeps phone and controller orientations separately, choosing fresh controller data in auto mode and the phone alone in forced mode.
// DM_PHONE_MOTION: auto (default) while no controller supplies fresh gyro data (a DualSense held apart from the phone uses its own, motion_apple.h), 1 always, 0 never.
// DM_MOTION=0 (all live motion off; the NSP script's --no-motion builds it in) never starts device motion.
// Which frame the samples come in: on iOS 27 and later the pad view (full screen, over the picture) is the motion body (CMMotionManager.deviceMotionBody), so Core Motion delivers
// them in that view's frame for whichever display shows it and however it is turned: x to the right of the picture, y to its top, z toward the player, the Switch frame as it is.
// Before that they come in the hardware frame, turned here by the interface orientation, which holds only where the hardware frame is the screen's portrait frame: not on iPhone
// Duo's inner display, whose picture is a quarter turn from it (up / down and left / right swapped, GitHub issue #569). Open: while the scene is not full screen (Split View on the
